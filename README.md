# PHP algos to make me learn PHP

This repository is repo. for me to learn PHP that I have to learn for school (I hate PHP, it's awful). You might learn PHP from this too.
In this README file will only be things I find weird, hate, interesting etc. In every folder will be one small project you can run, change, redo or whatever
I don't care ngl. Numbers before the folders mean which was made first, second etc. so you can see my growth better?

# HATE!!!

## $

Why is `$` it sucks!!! I always forget to use it. + It's pretty hard to type in on my keyboard layout.

## isset()

Why can't just the submit button (as example) can't be `false` when you don't click it. Like bro what else could it be (except if you're PHP).

## strlen() != count()

Why? No seriously, why can't it just be the same thing and return length of array or string? Are strings just something else than array of chars? Probably but still...

## . != +

I hate it, this ain't lua bro

# realization

PHP sucks, but I can accept PHP for what it is (bad programming language)
